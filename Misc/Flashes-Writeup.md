## 🎯 Challenge Approach

**Goal:** Slow the Video to find the Flag 

---

## 🔍 Solution

### Solution Process

1. **Video Analysis**: Opened the challenge video file in a standard video player
2. **Playback Speed Reduction**: Slowed the video playback to 0.25x (quarter speed) to capture details that flash quickly
3. **Frame-by-Frame Inspection**: Manually paused at intervals throughout the video to examine each section carefully
4. **Flag Extraction**: Identified and extracted the flag from the rapidly displayed frames

**Key Insight:** The challenge relies on content displayed at high speed within the video. By reducing playback speed and systematically reviewing each frame, the hidden flag becomes visible and readable.

### Tools Used
