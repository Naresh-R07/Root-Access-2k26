## 📋 Challenge Overview

[Challenge description to be added]

## 🎯 Challenge Approach

**Goal:** Slow the video to find the flag.

## 🔍 Solution

### Solution Process

1. Opened the challenge video file in a standard video player.
2. Slowed the video playback to 0.25x (quarter speed) to capture details that flash quickly.
3. Manually paused at intervals throughout the video to examine each section carefully.
4. Identified and extracted the flag from the rapidly displayed frames.

**Key Insight:** The challenge relies on content displayed at high speed within the video. By reducing playback speed and systematically reviewing each frame, the hidden flag becomes visible and readable.

### Tools Used
- Video player (with playback speed control).

## 🏁 Final Flag
